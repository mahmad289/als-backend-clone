How git branches are working in this application?

-> We have main branch which will be always be equal to production.
-> The staging branch will be used for demo purposes it can never be behind main branch. We will merge this branch in main after all stakeholders aprove it.
-> The development branch will be used for development purpose, developers will make their branches from it and also create PR for this branch.

General rules.

-> Never merge any branch directly always create PR. This is very important.
-> Everyone will do code review
